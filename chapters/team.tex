As shown throughout this paper, the Legacy Project involves several technical challenges. 
Legacy will not be an easy task, creating it will take time and will require a strong team capable of developing a product that will be used by our customers.

The Legacy team is composed by entrepreneurs and engineers with proven track records in creating, running and managing startup companies. Most of them participated in startup accelerator programs and founded companies which have delivered valuable products.
