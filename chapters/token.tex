\chapter{The Legacy Token} % (fold)
\label{cha:the_legacy_token}

The Legacy Token, called LEG, will be created during a token sale event organized to fund the project. The token sale process will follow standard modalities established in the blockchain community. Once the token sale period is finished, no additional tokens will be generated. A maximum of 100000000 LEG can be created. 
Table \ref{table:ico_summary} provides some preliminary\footnote{The details regarding token supply distribution are subject to further changes as the exact crowdsale modality is not yet defined.} details regarding the token and its supply distribution. Additional details regarding the token sale process and how to participate in it will be provided on Legacy's official website \cite{Legacy}.

The Legacy Token serves three main purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
	% TO-DO
	% \item PoL engine
	\item It allows to create a shared economy on top of Legacy's platform. In this way, once Legacy is able to handle digital assets holding monetary value, experts and professionals such as lawyers, accountants or notaries may provide technical assistance to users managing complex holdings or in case specific legal requirements must be met according to local regulations related to property disposition through wills. In this context, the legacy token can be used to enable peer-to-peer transfer of value on the platform.
	\item In line with the previous idea, tokens can be used to implement a reward and incentive system to encourage continuous platform development. Users may propose novel functionalities (\textit{e.g.}, a specific PoL plugin or a novel storage system) which can be implemented by developers in the community. Once a novel functionality is added to the platform, a fraction of the service fees are sent to its authors.
	This idea is further discussed in Section \ref{sub:a_reward_and_incentivisation_system}.
	\item Finally, LEG tokens can be used by users to gain access to commercial advantages. Paying for the service directly in LEG may give access to reduced service costs and other types of commercial incentives. This is a standard strategy to spur token demand and also allows implementation of fiscal policies regarding the token economy \cite{Sehra2017}.
