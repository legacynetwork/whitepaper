\label{sec:the_legacy_foundation}

Even if all technical aspects are working perfectly, finding people to deliver memories entrusted to Legacy may be difficult. Recipients may move, change their phone numbers, email addresses, etc. These edge cases can be handled by a separate, non-profit foundation.
The foundation will take care of correctly transmitting user’s assets if and only if purely automated means fail. 
The second mission of the foundation will be to advocate for change in the legislative process of transmitting properties.
In addition, the foundation may also run storage nodes to improve service reliability.

In order to ensure correct operation, the Legacy Foundation will receive a percentage of the service operation fees, which will be automatically transferred from user’s smart contracts once the service is paid.
