The Legacy project will be funded through a token crowdsale. The Legacy token, called LEG, serves two main purposes: it is used internally to execute the smart contracts residing in the Ethereum blockchain; and it allows for profit sharing among its holders. A simplified diagram showing how the token is employed in the application is included in Appendix \ref{cha:economic_flow_model}. The token sale process follows standard modalities established in the blockchain ecosystem. In addition, it is in the Legacy spirit to provide additional investor protection by following recent recommendations given by the community. In particular, a minimum cap (or soft cap) target has been established, meaning that investorâ€™s contributions will be refunded in case this target is not reached. Table \ref{table:ico_summary} summarizes the main aspects of the crowdsale.

LEG tokens will be created dynamically during the token sale period. Once this period is finished, no additional tokens will be generated. A maximum of 100.000.000 LEG will be created. The token sale period finishes automatically at the predefined ending date or when the maximum cap is reached, whichever comes first.

The token sale follows a linear ascending-price model, as shown in Table \ref{table:ico_token_price}.
