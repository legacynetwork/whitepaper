\label{sec:activities_resources}
The Legacy Team will work in two phases: the first one, starting immediately after the ICO, will be the implementation of our proposed solution. In the second phase, marketing, communication, legal, and customer service specialists will be added to the team to grow the user base, while production continues.

Using ICO funding, the first phase of the project is to publish the first stable release of Legacy I (Memoirs). Priority will be given to the development team, and marketing will be slowly ramped up as the release nears.

Key resources: blockchain specialists, developers, ICO funding.
