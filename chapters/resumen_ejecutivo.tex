\label{cha:executive_summary}

El uso de testamentos se remonta a la Antigua Grecia. Si bien su utilidad e implicancias legales varían entre diferentes culturas y épocas, las bases de su funcionamiento son similares.
A medida que transitamos hacia una sociedad y economía cada vez más digitalizadas, antiguas formas de valor---sean de carácter sentimental o monetario---son reemplazadas, lmacenadas y transmitidas en formatos digitales. Documentos impresos, libros, fotografías e incluso dinero son sólo algunos ejemplos de cosas que actualmente manejamos en forma digital.
En este contexto, disponer de nuestras posesiones digitales en caso de muerte en forma segura no es una tarea que se pueda realizar fácilmente a través del antiguo sistema que consiste en escribir un simple documento legal, vale decir, un testamento.
En particular, este enfoque requiere de la intervención de varios intermediarios de confianza (de acuerdo al marco legal específico, puede tratarse de un abogado, un albacea y/o un notario) y no garantiza propiedades esenciales como seguridad, fiabilidad y privacidad, siendo ésta última especialmente importante cuando se trata de transferir datos personales de alto significado.
Más aún, con la introducción de plataformas \textit{blockchain} y \textit{smart contracts}, por un lado, y con el inminente despliegue global de la \textit{Internet of Things (IoT)}, por el otro, esperamos la irrupción de un nuevo concepto de propiedad denominado \textit{smart property}; esto es, propiedades y bienes raíces que podrán ser fácilmente transados y transferidos sin necesidad de intermediarios. Al igul que las criptomonedas, la smart property requerirá de un enfoque diferente---así como un marco legal modernizado---para ser transferida o legada en forma segura.
El presente documento describe \textit{Legacy}, un servicio basado en tecnología blockchain que busca convertirse en el primer \textit{smart will}, o testamento inteligente. En principio, Legacy permitirá disponer de archivos digitales, referidos como \textit{memories}, tales como imágenes, videos, manuscritos diitalizados o cualquier otro tipo de datos de valor sentimental para un individuo. 
El problema asociado al manejo y disposición de activos digitales de valor monetario (tales como criptomonedas) luego de la muerte del propietario es considerado posteriormente.
De acuerdo a las proyecciones discutidas en este documento, Legacy evolucionará gradualmente hacia una plataforma cada vez más decentralizada y auto-sostenible basada en un sistema de recompensa gestionado por la comunidad de usuarios y desarrolladores.
En el largo plazo, a medida que el concepto smart property se concretiza y los sistemas legales se adaptan a los cambios impuestos por la blockchain, Legacy espera posicionarse la solución \textit{de facto} en cuanto a \textit{smart wills}, eliminando progresivamente la necesidad de intermediarios de confianza (incluyendo la propia organización Legacy) y asegurando propiedades clave como seguridad, privacidad, fiabilidad y operabilidad sostenida en el tiempo.

% % TO-DO: extend the following, sounds like abstract.
% This paper introduces Legacy\footnote{Here we only discuss technical aspects of the project. Additional relevant information, such as business plan, team information and development roadmap, can be found in \url{https://legacy.network}}, a blockchain-based service that aims at becoming the first \textit{smart will}. At a first stage, Legacy allows distribution of what we refer to as \textit{memories}; \textit{i.e.}, digital items such as images, video recordings, manuscripts or other forms of digital data that capture valuable life experiences.
% The problem of securely managing digital assets of higher monetary value (such as cryptocurrency holdings) in the event of the owner's death is considered afterwards.
% Legacy will evolve gradually into a more decentralized, self-sustainable architecture implementing an incentivisation platform for peer-to-peer services.
% In the long term, as smart property becomes a reality and law embraces blockchain technology, Legacy aims at positioning as the \textit{de facto} smart will solution, progressively eliminating the need for trusted third parties (including the Legacy organization) and ensuring key attributes such as security, privacy and long-term operation.

% \section{Problem Statement} % (fold)
% \label{sec:problem_statement}

% The traditional process of transferring property---whether in the form of real estate, money or ordinary valuable objects---through a will and testament involves several issues.

% % need for a trusted third party
% In general, the process depends entirely on an executor, who is in charge of administrating the legacy and is appointed by the testator (\textit{i.e.}, the person who writes the will). An executor must be trustworthy. Depending on the legal framework, writing a conventional will might require the intervention of additional intermediaries, such as a lawyer and a notary. In many cases, however, these are not legally indispensable, which suggests that the process can be systematized in order to be easily self-completed by the testators. 

% % integrity and confidentiality
% Wills are written as ordinary documents, and can get lost or destroyed. Since they must be easily accessible by the executors when the moment arrives, wills are usually not stored securely.This compromises the content's integrity and confidentiality. As a consequence, conventional wills are inherently unreliable.

% % legging digital data  
% Wills are in general limited to the distribution of monetary valuable possessions and are not suitable for managing personal digital data. Nowadays, most of our important life experiences and memories are captured in emails, digital images, videos, and other digital items. These are also part of our legacy and require attention. But conventional wills are not meant for this. While some software solutions addressing this problem exist, they are based on centralized architectures that provide limited guarantees in terms of reliability and long-term operation.

% % flexibility
% A conventional will is defined and executed once. Making further modifications after it has been signed is in general not possible and requires rewriting the entire document. A will is also inherently static; it cannot be automatically adapted according to changes in future conditions or unpredictable events. In addition, the process of executing a will may take significant time. Much of the process can be accelerated and systematized by taking advantage of simple software solutions. 
% The OpenLaw protocol recently proposed by Consensys \cite{OpenLaw} is an interesting innovation on this subject. 

% % managing crypto holdings
% Finally, there is the problem of securely transferring cryptocurrencies. Currently, cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets that can be accessed through a private key or password-protected encrypted files. If an individual holding cryptocurrencies dies without having communicated his/her wallet credentials to third persons, then the entire wallet balances are irrevocably lost.

% \subsubsection*{Simplifying the process of transferring digital possessions in the event of death} % (fold)
% \label{ssub:simplifying_the_process_of_transferring_your_digital_possessions_after_your_death}
% Legacy is designed to be an easy-to-use application. 
% Since Legacy points to a wide public, including seniors and baby boomers, its usability and accessibility properties are one of its most important aspects.
% Users should be able to create and configure an account in a few steps, without the need for setting-up external services (\textit{e.g.}, a third-party storage service).

% \subsubsection*{A service that ensures security, reliability, privacy and long-term operation} % (fold)
% \label{ssub:a_service_that_ensures_security_reliability_privacy_and_long_term_operation}
% Legacy's core logic will reside in the Ethereum blockchain, which guarantees its integrity and availability in the future. 
% A large blockchain network such as Ethereum guarantees long-term operation because it does not rely on a single organization. Shutting it down would require to disable a large number of its nodes.
% A blockchain also allows to securely transfer digital assets without the need for intermediaries.
% User's data will be stored using a distributed file system, ensuring privacy and reliability.
% A design approach oriented towards decentralization is also essential to further meet these properties.

% \subsubsection*{Reducing the need for trusted third parties for creating and executing a will} % (fold)
% \label{ssub:reducing_the_need_for_trusted_third_parties_for_creating_and_executing_a_will}
% The need for trusted third parties for transferring property usually has more to do with legal issues rather than with technical aspects. From a technical standpoint, advanced algorithms combined with smart contracts allow to simplify the process. In some cases, however, creating a will may be a complex process (for instance, for people holding a large variety of assets), and some legal assistance is necessary. We propose a solution to this problem based on decentralized platform, in which lawyers and accountants may offer assistance.

% \label{ssub:_an_enhanced_smart_will_allowing_to_transfer_cryptocurrency_and_smart_property_}
% Our ultimate goal is to integrate a wide variety of transferable items, including cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets, as well as smart property. This the long-term vision of the Legacy project and represents the main problems that we aim to tackle. This goal, however, involves a number of technical challenges and legal issues that need to be overcome---as we discuss in more detail later on.

% % Overview of Legacy and Use Cases
% % ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
% \section{Overview of Legacy and Use Cases} % (fold)
% \label{sec:overview_of_legacy_and_use_cases}
% In the short to mid terms, Legacy plans to deliver two main releases: Legacy v1.0 \textit{Memoirs} and Legacy v2.0 \textit{Heritage}---the main differences between both being in the underlying software architecture. Further releases including enhanced capabilities---such as the ability to manage smart property---are also considered over the medium and long terms, as technological and legal issues are overcome. This document focuses mainly on Legacy versions \textit{Memoirs} and \textit{Heritage}, which we may refer indistinctly to as Legacy in the following. 

% Initially, Legacy will allow to securely transfer any form of digital data such as pictures, videos, audio files and text documents. Files will be stored using a decentralized, encrypted system. Each individual file belonging to a given user represents a memory. Memories can be bundled into capsules that a user may schedule for transfer to one or more recipients upon death and/or upon a specific set of verifiable events\footnote{By \textit{verifiable} event we refer to any event or condition that can be automatically verified and signaled to the blockchain (for instance, using an Oracle) with some minimum amount of reliability}. This way, a capsule can be programmed in many different ways, forming a smart will. For instance, a user might want to send an email to his/her children once they turn eighteen years old or share with them special memories for important days of their lives such as graduation or marriage. A user can easily specify which are the events and conditions that trigger a capsule transfer.

% An important function of the Legacy application is to determine precisely and timely whether the user is alive or not---ideally without involving interaction with family members. This is verified periodically through a mechanism called Proof of Life (PoL). The PoL engine uses different criteria in order to make a reliable decision, and its operation can be completely customized by the user. For instance, PoL can be based on social network activity patterns---which has the advantage of not requiring explicit signaling from the user---or on periodic email notifications asking the user to simply click on a link. Different PoL mechanisms can be combined in order to achieve a desired level of reliability and user experience. Once the PoL engine determines that the user has died, the capsules are scheduled for further distribution.

% \section{Cryptocurrencies and Smart Property: The Legacy Vision} % (fold)
% \label{sec:cryptocurrencies_and_smart_property_the_legacy_vision}

% With the introduction of blockchain technologies and smart contracts, as well as with the global deployment of the IoT, a new generation of smart property will rapidly become a reality.
% The importance of the IoT in this context is in that it will allow smart property to seamlessly interact with the blockchain. 
% In the same way as the Internet extended to \textit{things}, blockchains will integrate them as well, opening a variety of new applications.
% At this stage, the challenges involved in implementing smart wills allowing to dispose any type of property are no longer technological, but mostly legal. Trading and transferring smart property will be easily achieved leveraging the benefits provided by the blockchain.% TO-DO
% In fact, recent projects such as REAL \cite{REAL} already provide a link between real estate and the cryptocurrency world, allowing to easily transfer property shares using blockchain technology.


% In the long term, it is highly likely that people as well as private and public institutions will hold important fractions of their assets in the form of cryptocurrencies. Indeed, a recent report by the World Economic Forum predicts that 10\% of the global GDP will be stored on the blockchain within a decade \cite{WEF2017}.  
% Enabling disposition of blockchain-based assets after death will become a problem of significant importance in the near future.
